## Implementation Notes

### Team System Design
- **Team Types**: 
  - Popular gym chains (Gold's Gym, Planet Fitness, Anytime Fitness, etc.)
  - Local/independent gyms
  - University teams
  - Custom team names
- **Team Representation**: Each team can have multiple members, but only the strongest lifter in each category represents the team in inter-team competitions
- **Team Challenges**: Teams can challenge other teams, with each team's strongest lifters competing in head-to-head matches

### Technical Considerations
- Ensure team names are validated and normalized
- Implement team search and autocomplete functionality

- Plan for team management features (team admins, member invitations)
